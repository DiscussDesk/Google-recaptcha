# Google-recaptcha
Google reCAPTCHA is a free reCAPTCHA tool to prevent your web forms from any kind of spam bot or abuse. We have developed a library in <a href="https://www.discussdesk.com/integrate-google-recaptcha-in-php-with-example.htm">PHP to integrate Google reCAPTCHA in PHP with example</a>.

To demonstrate the Google reCAPTCHA service, we have created a contact form and added Google reCAPTCHA checkbox. When any user checks the checkbox then our library calls the Google reCAPTCHA API and validate the user. If the Google reCAPTCHA API returns success then you can proceed with forms input.
